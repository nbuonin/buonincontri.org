## About Me

I am a software engineer with 6 years experience building web applications for
various audiences. I currently work as a programmer for the [Center for
Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.columbia.edu) at Columbia University.  At
the CTL, I collaborate with developers, designers, and learning experts to
build applications that improve learning outcomes for students across the
university.

My technical interests range the gamut, from finding ways to incorporate type
safety into my projects, doing unexpected things with Docker containers, and
experimenting with data sonification.
