## About Me

I am currently working as a web development for the Center for Teaching and
Learning at Columbia University.  At the CTL, I work on a team with
developers, designers, and learning experts to build tools for faculty to
improve learning outcomes for students across the university.

My technical interests range the gamut, from finding ways to incorporate
type safety into my projects, to doing fun things with Docker.
