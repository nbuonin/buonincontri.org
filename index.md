## About Me

I am a software engineer with 6 years of experience build web applications for
various audiences. I currently work as a programmer for the Center for
Teaching and Learning at Columbia University.  At the CTL, I am on a team with
developers, designers, and learning experts that build tools to improve
learning outcomes for students across the university.

My technical interests range the gamut, from finding ways to incorporate
type safety into my projects, to doing fun things with Docker.
